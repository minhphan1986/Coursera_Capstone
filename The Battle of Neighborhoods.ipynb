It is therefore a good time for many young couples to start investing in the property market.\n\n### Business Problem\nCurrently, the median apartment price is $690,000. The question raised is \"Among the affordable suburbs with median price less than $690,000, which one is the best for investment?\" We define \"the best\" as \"having many amenities and essential surrounding facilities such as elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores\"\n\n## Data section\n\n"
